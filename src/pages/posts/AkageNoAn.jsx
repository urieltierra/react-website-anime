              Akage no Anne, or Anne of Green Gables as we know it better in the
              West, is one of those anime that shake the childhood memories of
              those of us who have reached a certain age (phew, how solemn that
              is). If it is not because we have seen it, it is because of
              references, since it comes from the indispensable television
              container World Masterpiece Theatre, to which also belonged the
              series of Marco, Tom Sawyer, Little Women and other literary
              classics that were, in turn, a significant part of the inclusion
              of anime in the Spanish-speaking market. Although not produced by
              Nippon Animation, Heidi of the Alps is the most famous example of
              the spirit represented by WMT: family orientation, recognizable
              Western literary works, careful slice of life with a child in the
              main role and precious staging.

              Starting in 1969 (with Osamu Tezuka's production company MushiPro
              at the stove) until 1997 (from 1975 with Nippon Animation), it
              worked on dozens of animated series that marked the childhood of
              millions of people. There was a tiny resurrection during 2007-2009
              with a trio of works (including the Akage no Anne prequel), but a
              return has not been mooted again. Perhaps because it hosts a type
              of anime that doesn't connect with contemporary otaku; perhaps
              because today's audiences expect more immediate and spectacular
              products. In Japan, however, the World Masterpiece Theatre is
              vital to understand the history of cartoons, its impact on the
              population was remarkable and, although it lost fame as anime
              wandered in new directions, its quality and influence was never
              questioned. It is not surprising then that great animators such as
              Yoshiyuki Tomino, Toyoo Ashida... or two much more renowned ones:
              Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki, put their efforts and expertise
              into it.

              This prodigious duo, known to every self-respecting smelly otaco,
              joined forces to produce an anime with an intelligent female
              protagonist and a strong personality, something that would later
              become a characteristic of Ghibli heroines. Yoshifumi Kond么, whose
              steps would also end up in the mythical studios, would also work
              with them. Takahata was in charge of the direction, Miyazaki of
              his wonderful backgrounds, Tomino of the storyboard and Kond么 of
              the animation and character design. Quite a team. Even a mediocre
              short story would have been a marvel with such professionals
              behind the scenes, so how could we not expect something
              extraordinary starting from a fantastic base! Because the literary
              work on which the anime was based, Anne of the Green Gables (1908)
              by Lucy Maud Montgomery, is one of the most important and
              representative novels of her native Canada. A universal classic.

            <p className="single-text-description">
              Does "universal" include Japan? Of course it does. In fact, Anne
              of Green Gables is a much-admired saga in the country. Since its
              first translation in 1952, its fame has not stopped growing,
              becoming one of the most widely read and loved books by the
              Japanese female public. It could be considered a sh么jo sh么setsu
              (novel for young girls) in its own right, despite being a foreign
              work. It is not surprising that in Japan this series of books
              reached the level of a social phenomenon, since it expresses in a
              clear way a very, very Japanese characteristic: the idealization
              and love for Nature. The delicate attention to the passing of the
              seasons, its exquisite descriptions. Anyone who has dived, even
              superficially, in the ocean of the literature of the islands, will
              have inevitably come across this taste for the contemplation of
              trees, flowers, mountains and their beautiful futility (mono no
              aware).

              They had reached the slope of a hill. Below them was a lagoon that
              seemed almost like a river, so large and irregular was it. A
              bridge crossed it, and from there to its lower end, where the
              amber belt of sands separated it from the dark distant gulf, the
              water was a symphony of glorious hues: the most spiritual of
              saffron, pinks, and ethereal green, mingled with others so unreal
              that there is no name for them. Beyond the bridge, the pond
              reached into a grove of spruce and maple trees, reflecting their
              shifting shadows here and there; a wild plum tree stood out from
              the margin, like a girl on tiptoe contemplating her own image.
              From the thicket at the far end of the pond came the clear, sadly
              sweet chorus of frogs.

              Could Takahata and Miyazaki resist a work that sang so
              stentorianly of the ideals they would later embody again and again
              in Ghibli? Certainly not, which is why they did not hesitate to
              travel to Prince Edward Island to get to know in situ the
              landscapes that Montgomery knew how to capture so well. The
              landscapes and the way of life of its people, because both the
              novels (11 volumes complete the series) and the anime are a real
              slice of life. And the beautiful rural life that Anne Shirley
              enjoys is what is shown in the first novel and in these cartoons.

              Anne of Green Gables is a moving book, written with exceptional
              affection and subtlety. Simple, funny, profound. It is supposed to
              be aimed at the young reader, but its essence is so generous that
              it transcends the barriers of age and gender. It is a novel for
              anyone to enjoy, because it has the ability to squeeze the kokoro
              with its gentleness. And without sentimentality. It is a work that
              has had dozens of adaptations over the decades, some more
              fortunate than others; but, undoubtedly, for me its best and most
              faithful incarnation is the animated by Isao Takahata. There is no
              color. This being a forceful declaration of principles, you can
              already imagine where the review is going to go. Akage no Anne is
              a 10 series, and I don't come across many like it. It is not just
              a mere (but great) adaptation, it breaks the umbilical cord of the
              book, it has a life of its own.

              As the title suggests, Akage no Anne is the story of an orphan,
              Anne Shirley, and her peaceful existence in the fictional village
              of Avonlea. It is a detailed portrait of a restless, romantic
              11-year-old girl with an exuberant imagination. She has not had an
              easy life, and it has been precisely the fantasy of her mind that
              has helped her to satisfy her affective deficiencies. As a refuge,
              as a consolation; always walking between the blurred border
              between reality and reverie. The misfortunes she has suffered have
              also shaped her personality, making her a strong and willful girl,
              with a bombproof optimism and a heart as tender as a sponge cake.
              She is honest and impetuous, with an almost comical tendency to
              melodrama, but also a brilliant intellect. Anne is endearing, it
              is impossible not to love her as she grows and matures little by
              little. The child, the adolescent, the young woman. Her physical
              and psychological evolution is done with so much care and love
              that it is very easy to empathize with the character. She has so
              many nuances that it is difficult not to see yourself reflected in
              her in some way.
            </p>
            <p className="single-text-description">
              Akage no Anne is a serenely paced bildungsroman focused above all
              on the small tragedies and joys of the everyday; the complexities
              of day-to-day life, its dilemmas. And in this Takahata maintains a
              marvelous pulse, blending fantasy and realism in a fascinating
              way. With total naturalness, the world of Anne and Avonlea unfolds
              before our eyes. The richness of its details overwhelms, because
              they are shown at the same time with the utmost simplicity. And
              that world is not only inhabited by Anne and her untamed
              imagination, that world is brimming with characters without whom
              the horizon would be barren land.

            <p className="single-text-description">
              As an undisputed masterpiece of slice of life, Anne of Green
              Gables boasts a cast of robust and painstaking secondary
              characters. They appear with a harmonious cadence, like life
              itself in Avonlea, and like pieces of a puzzle, they build a
              solidly rooted reality. Everyone has an important role to play in
              Anne's story. What would she be without Marilla's good sense and
              pragmatism? At first I didn't want her on the farm, it was
              frustrating to find that instead of a boy who could help them, a
              chattering, head-in-the-clouds stripling emerged out of nowhere.
              But Marilla, despite her toughness, is fair and compassionate.
              Would Anne be just as happy without Matthew? He, who was smitten
              with our redhead as soon as he saw her, spoils her like a little
              princess. His noble and shy soul is fundamental for Anne. And what
              about Diana? Her first and dearest friend, the boys at school,
              Gilbert Blythe, the irritating Mrs. Lynde, Reverend Allan and his
              wife? Many, many more are on parade.
            </p>
            <p className="single-text-description">
              One of the most striking things about Akage no Anne is the almost
              total absence of sentimental resources when it comes to reflecting
              conflicts or moments of strong emotional intensity. Takahata
              imposes a harmonious narrative with a gradual flow. Very
              entertaining and, at the same time, thoughtful. Although Anne has
              a natural predisposition for melodramatic exaltation, she is
              completely enveloped in the scenario of ordinary life. The
              feelings that crystallize in the anime do not suffer from
              diabetes, they show their greatness without fuss and in a very
              human way. Oddly enough, perhaps it is that aspect that makes the
              series so endearing. Not in the strident way to which Disney has
              accustomed us, but precisely because of its restraint and
              subtlety. Something that later on we could also observe in
              Ghibli's productions.

              And yes, the spirit of Ghibli can be perceived throughout the
              series: in its extraordinary art and backgrounds, in its
              philosophy and love of Nature, in its prodigious heroine, in the
              coming-of-age of its story. The character designs, though crude
              compared to today's characters, have an elegance in their
              ingenuity that is very effective and expressive. They are perfect
              moving in those lay-outs of magnificent finesse. Technically,
              Akage no Anne is a piece to be studied and valued, placing it
              above other sisters of the World Masterpiece Theatre.
            </p>
            <p className="single-text-description">
              Anne of Green Gables is a gentle series for the whole family. Its
              apparent simplicity hides one of the most meticulous and intricate
              works I have observed in a slice of life. And with excellent
              results. However, we must always keep in mind that this is an
              anime from 1979, so we should not demand technical means that did
              not exist yet. It has been a delight to go through those 50
              episodes again, because at no time, and I repeat, at no time, has
              it become tedious or repetitive. That is the magic that master
              Takahata conjured up.

            <p className="single-text-description">
              Somehow, it seems that in the West there has been a kind of
              tendency to forget works aimed at children, especially if they are
              relics from almost forty years ago. Sh么nen and seinen have a bit
              more predicament, however it would be a colossal mistake to
              overlook a work of the caliber of Akage no Anne. Anime antique
              lovers like me should be in no doubt: it's a must-see. Casual
              viewers of anime, and who also know the novel, would be (very)
              pleasantly surprised. The otacos of the 21st century would have to
              hang their prejudices in the closet and put their snouts in the
              guts of this marvel. Anne changed the lives of all those who met
              her in Avonlea, it can change yours too if you decide to give it a
              chance. Summary: Akage no Anne is a must read.
