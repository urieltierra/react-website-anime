              “[Barefoot] Gen burned its way into my heated brain with the
              intensity of a fever dream” Art Spiegelman notes in his
              introduction to Barefoot Gen Vol. 1. Even without the fever,
              Spiegelman was experiencing through his first read, Keiji
              Nakazawa’s semi-autobiographical manga is sure to stay with you
              long after you’ve consumed its final pages. Though it may seem
              childish in the first few panels, with its fart jokes and loud,
              childish, leads, Barefoot Gen refuses to look away from the
              atrocities committed by both America and Japan in World War II.

              Keiji Nakazawa’s internationally renowned manga Barefoot Gen,
              which depicts wartime atrocities from the perspective of the
              seven-year-old protagonist, has fallen victim to several
              challenges in its home country of Japan. Barefoot Gen is loosely
              based on Nakazawa’s own childhood, as his father, two sisters, and
              a brother were killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima when he
              was seven years old. Nakazawa died of lung cancer in 2012, but his
              widow Misayo said he felt strongly “that he must share with
              children accounts of the miseries of the war and the atomic
              bombing to prevent a recurrence.” To aid in this effort, he
              donated 2,735 original drawings from the manga and 30 boxes of
              other materials to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.

              Tomoko Watanabe of the nonprofit peace group ANT-Hiroshima said
              that Nakazawa’s message successfully connected with young readers:
              “The work does describe brutal scenes, but children are
              intrinsically able to get to the essence of the story — that
              people should live despite the difficulties. We must trust the
              children and let them read as they want to.” Instead, Matsue
              officials apparently prefer to shield students from real-life
              events and risk the realization of Nakazawa’s worst fear for a new
              generation.

              The book shows bomb victims “with their skin rotting and falling
              off their bodies…while others are seen dismembered,” but it also
              does not shy away from atrocities committed by Japanese troops in
              other Asian countries. It was these events, such as the Rape of
              Nanking and “a publicized account of two soldiers aiming to kill
              100 Chinese citizens first in a contest,” that caused a Matsue
              citizen to challenge the book’s presence in schools. Many Japanese
              nationalists deny that such war crimes were ever committed by
              their country’s troops. Matsue’s board of education did not
              address the history revisionism behind the challenge but instead
              said that the manga may be too graphically violent for children to
              read on their own.

              The series was pulled from primary and middle school libraries in
              the Japanese city of Matsue. Keiji Nakazawa’s celebrated series
              was removed after the complainant — one who does not even live in
              the prefecture where Matsue City is located — called the book an
              “ultra-leftist manga that perpetuated lies and instilled defeatist
              ideology in the minds of young Japanese.” Citing “portions that
              warrant consideration as appropriate reading material for
              children,” school officials barred students from checking out the
              manga but allowed teachers to continue using it in classrooms. The
              Matsue City school board overturned the order that banned Barefoot
              Gen from school libraries, but they didn’t do it over concerns of
              censorship. The board cited concerns over procedural problems with
              the decision.

            <p className="single-text-description">
              A little more than a month after Keiji Nakazawa’s manga classic
              Barefoot Gen was restored to school libraries in Matsue, an
              English-language translator of the series has been abruptly
              disinvited from speaking at a junior high school in suburban
              Tokyo, 400 miles away. School officials there obliquely cited
              “recent circumstances” and “social trends” as their reason for
              canceling the translator’s visit. In early 2014, a mayor in
              Izumisano City in the Osaka Prefecture, Japan, demanded that all
              copies of Barefoot Gen be removed from elementary and junior high
              schools in the district. Izumisano City’s mayor, Hiroyasu
              Chiyomatsu, felt compelled to review the manga after it was
              temporarily banned in Matsue City. Chiyomatsu called for the
              removal in Izumisano City because he feels that the book
              discriminated against the mentally ill and poor. The district has
              eight elementary schools and five junior high schools, so the ban
              affected a relatively large number of students.

            <p className="single-text-description">
              After Chiyomatsu expressed concern in November about “many
              expressions in the manga that impact human rights,” his political
              ally and appointee Tatsuhiro Nakafuji, superintendent of Izumisano
              schools, passed a resolution to collect all 128 copies of the book
              from district libraries. Many schools refused to cooperate,
              however, so, in January, Nakafuji personally collected the
              remaining copies. Following this action, the local school
              principals’ association sent two letters of protest to the school
              board, saying that “[t]o deny children the chance to read the
              manga grounded in [a] certain sense of values and ideas is a
              violation of their human rights.” In response to media coverage
              and protests from educators and citizens, the school board claimed
              that it had planned all along to only withhold the books until
              March 20, after making “preparations to provide guidance to
              students regarding the problematic expressions.”

              In the final words of his forward, Nakazawa notes his use of wheat
              as a symbol throughout his story, “Trampled wheat sends strong
              roots into the earth and grows straight and tall. And one day,
              that wheat bears fruit.” Barefoot Gen is strong-rooted,
              fruit-bearing wheat, despite its adversity. Take a moment to read
              Nakazawa’s tale, and help those roots sink a little deeper.
